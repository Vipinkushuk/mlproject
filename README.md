Student Score Prediction using Machine Learning
This project aims to predict student scores based on various external factors such as study hours, socioeconomic background, attendance, extracurricular activities, and more. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the goal is to identify the most effective algorithm for accurately predicting student performance.

Project Overview
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Performed EDA to understand the data distribution, detect patterns, and identify correlations between different factors and student scores.
Visualized data to spot trends and insights, and handled any missing or inconsistent data.
Feature Engineering:

Selected and engineered features that are most relevant to predicting student scores.
Normalized and scaled data to ensure that all variables contribute equally to the model.
Model Training:

Implemented various machine learning algorithms, including:
Linear Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
XGBoost
Evaluated each model's performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
Model Selection:

Compared the performance of different algorithms and selected the most efficient model based on accuracy and computational efficiency.
Prediction and Validation:

Used the selected model to predict student scores and validated its performance on test data.
Analyzed the model's predictions to fine-tune and improve accuracy.
Key Findings
Identified key factors that significantly influence student scores.
Demonstrated that certain algorithms perform better under specific conditions and datasets.
Technologies Used
